  Hello,
 # PyBattery
- From my previous post about this topic I came to know about some problems that it has, In this post, I will be covering the problems with my new algorithm.

- Problems faced my user from my previous program:- 

- 1) Extensive battery use hence making a lot of heat.

- 2)Overprinting of the battery data.

- UPDATE

- 1)This problem is solved by 'psutil' package which is an in-built package of python using the sleep function.

- 2)Introduced the new feature which will remind if the user forgot to plug the charger and executed the program.
